# hello-world
This is my first time of using Git-Hub, and also the beginning of my professional career in programming. It's a simple line of code that just says hello world!
Hi! My name is Adekunle Adesoji, and I live in Lagos Nigeria. I'm a science and technology enthusiast, that's why I've decided to learn how to code. My major purpose in life is making valuable inventions for improving people's standard of living as well as advancing the course of human civilization.
